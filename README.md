# Investment calculator

<p>This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.0-next.2.</p>
<p>Exercise suggestion from Udemy course [Angular - The Complete Guide (2024 Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2) about the Angular basics.</p>
<p>The function that generates the investment values was implemented by the course instructor (Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller) because it is outside of my area of expertise, but I created the rest of the code and integrated this function into my code.</p>

## Development server

<p>You can download the code and install with `npm install`. Please, note that for running `npm` you need to install NodeJS.</p>
<p>So, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and see the application running.</p>

## Project overview

<p>Here are some images to illustrate the project. The basic idea is insert some values of an investment and receive a table that shows the investment results.</p>

<p>The fields have some validation too and the "Calculate" button is disabled when one or more fields don't pass in the valdation.</p>
